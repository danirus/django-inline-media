Introduction
============

**django-inline-media** allows insertion of inline media content in your text fields. Based on `django-basic-apps/inlines <https://github.com/nathanborror/django-basic-apps>`_, it provives the following features:

.. index::
   single: Features

1. Inserts pictures and collection of pictures into your texts using the ``TextAreaWithInlines`` widget.

2. Positions media content at different places and sizes (mini/small/medium/large at left/right or full at the left/center/right).

3. Facilitates administration with thumbnails and search by tags, author and license.

4. Shows a customised control to insert media content in text fields.

5. Uses jquery `prettyPhoto <http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/>`_ to show pictures and galleries when clicking on them.

6. Tested under:

   * Python 2.7 and Python 3 (3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6)
   * Django 1.8, Django 1.9 and Django 1.10


The following sample shows a centered inline picture set inserted in a text, on mouseover event the first 3 photos unfold:

Quick start
===========

1. Get the dependencies::

    $ pip install -r requirements.pip

2. In your ``settings.py``:

* Add ``inline_media``, ``sorl.thumbnail`` and ``tagging`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

* Add ``THUMBNAIL_BACKEND = "inline_media.sorl_backends.AutoFormatBackend"``

* Add ``THUMBNAIL_FORMAT = "JPEG"``

3. Create a model with a field of type ``TextFieldWithInlines``.

4. Create an admin class for that model by inheriting from both ``inline_media.admin.AdminTextFieldWithInlinesMixin`` and Django's ``admin.ModelAdmin``.

5. Optionally, customise inline_media templates by copying them from ``inline_media/templates/inline_media/`` to your ``inline_media/`` folder in your templates directory.

5. Run ``manage.py`` commands: ``syncdb``, ``collectstatic``, ``runserver``.

6. Create two `InlineType` objects, one for the `Picture` model and one for the `PictureSet` model.

7. Upload some pictures and create some picture sets.

8. Add content to the model using the field ``TextFieldWithInlines`` and see that you can insert inline content in the textarea. It will be rendered in the position indicated by the CSS class selected in the dropdown box.

9. Hit your app's URL!

Run the **demo** in ``django-inline-media/examples/demo`` to see an example.
